        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup of margarine</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>&frac14; teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup white sugar</li>
            <li>&frac14; teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 &frac12; inches deep.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.</li>
            <li>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot.</li>
